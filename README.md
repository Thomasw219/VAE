This is a Variational Autoencoder Implementation trained on MNIST
The dimension of the latent variable is chosen to be 3 for visualization purposes. Higher dimensional latent variables will likely get better performance.
This was implemented for my 16-811 project on Variational Inference and Information Theory.
